# Toolkit - Swiss

**Active Project**

**Official version:** [0.2](#version-flow);

I created this simple chrome extension to help me on my researches on the web. It's incomplete, but I have ideas to improve it. I am doing it slowly, because I only code it on free time. I have been developing it for a short time, although it's already useful for me on daily basis.

## Description

I coded it in a way to make the new tools that I will create more easy to implement, focusing only in the tool itself. The base of injecting and parsing html already done. I'm writing a blogpost (release soon) about it, maybe it can be useful to someone.

The template files are not needed anymore. I modulated the **Tool** class to make easy and clean to implement new tools. Now it's much more simplier and faster. I still working on it to make it more flexible and faster.

You can see on the tools available to see how code new tools. I documented the Tool class to make easy to understand. There is a JSDoc about it on link [Link JSDOC]. Hope this could be useful.

I posted some overview of the ToolKit Swiss and hot to implement a new tool on my blog:
