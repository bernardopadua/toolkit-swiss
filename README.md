# Toolkit - Swiss

**Active Project**

I created this simple chrome extension to help me on my researches on the web. It's incomplete, but I have ideas to improve it. I am doing it slowly, because I only code it on free time. I have been developing it for a short time, although it's already useful for me on daily basis.

## Description

I coded it in a way to make the new tools that I will create more easy to implement, focusing only in the tool itself. The base of injecting and parsing html already done. I'm writing a blogpost (release soon) about it, maybe it can be useful to someone.

I've added the __template.*__ files that have the basics to implement a new tool. You must do some editing on **type.js, toolkit.js and frontend.js** to call the new tool, but nothing too much. It's fully commented.

Any idea, bug, question just send it to me, I will be glad helping.

## Tools so far

* TranslateIt
* HexConverter
* Base_64 Converter [Soon]
* Others incoming...
